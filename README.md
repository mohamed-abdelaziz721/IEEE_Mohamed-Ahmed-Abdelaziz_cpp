# Pointers

> Pointers are variables that store the memory addresses of other variables. For any `variable` we can have its address by `&variable`.


```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // declare variable
    int var1 = 3;
    int var2 = 5;


    // print address of var1
    cout << "Address of var1: "<< &var1 << endl;
    / print address of var2
    cout << "Address of var2: "<< &var2 << endl;

}
```
You will see an output that begin with `0x` which indicate the address of the variable in the memory. 
**notice:** `int` variable has a size of 4 byte in a 64-bit operating system.  


## Pointer Declaratrion And Assigning
```c++
// pointer declaration
int* ptr;
// or int *ptr
  
// assigning address to pointer
int* ptr, var;
var = 10;
ptr = &var;

//accessing the value of the ptr
cout<< "(*ptr):" <<*ptr << endl;   // output: 10

//changing value pointed by the pointer
*ptr = 5;
cout << "var:"<< var << endl;      // output: 5
```
**notice:** 
* we used `*` after the data type to declare a pointer.
* `var`is not a pointer.
* we stored `var` address into `ptr`.
* we used `*` **dereference operator** to print the value stored in this address.
* we can change the `var` content by working with pointers. 

> *note* `*ptr`  has a value and `&var` is an address so we cannot write `*ptr = &var`.

>  `ptr` is an address and `var` has a value so we cannot write `ptr = var`


## Pointers And Arrays
Pointers can store address of cells of an array. Array is a static pointer.
```c++
int *ptr;
int arr[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
 // address of the first element of the array is stored in the pointer ptr
ptr = arr;  // or ptr = &arr[0];
```
Here the pointer points to the address of the first element of the array.


**Navigation through the array using pointers**
```c++
int *ptr;
int arr[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
ptr = arr;
// printing address of array elements using pointers
 for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
 {
    cout<< "ptr + " << i << "=" << ptr + i << endl;
    //printing address of array elements 
    // cout<< "&arr[" << i << "] = " << &arr[i] << endl;
 }
 
 
 // printing values of array elements using pointers
 for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
 {
    cout<< "*(ptr + " << i << " ) =" << *(ptr + i) << endl;
    //printing values of array elements 
    // cout<< "arr[" << i << "] = " << arr[i] << endl;
}

cout << arr << endl;
cout << arr +1 << endl;
cout << *arr << endl;
cout << *arr+1 << endl;
cout << *(arr+1) << endl;

```

> If we initialize `ptr  = &arr[1]` we will have 

> ptr - 1  is same as &arr[0]

> ptr + 1  is same as &arr[2]

> ptr + 2  is same as &arr[3]


#### Array name used as a pointer
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5];
    
   // Insert data using pointer notation
    cout << "Enter 5 numbers: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) 
    {
        // store input number in arr[i]
        cin >> *(arr + i) ;
    }

    // printing data using pointer notation
    cout << "Array elements: " << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) 
    {
        // print value of arr[i] 
        cout << *(arr + i) << endl ; 
        // *(arr++) will give an error as it mean changing the array address which is the first element 
        // *(ptr++)  is normal operation 
        
    }
    return 0;
}
```
**notice** we did not declare a pointer, but instead we used the array name for the pointer notation.
This is an h3 heading
To see what is wrong with arr++ we use a simplified example:
```c++
int a = 0;
cout << a+1 << endl; // output: 1 but a is still holding value of 0 in the memory
cout << a++ << endl; // output: 1 but a now hold a value 1 in the memory  
```

## Passing Arguments To Function

We can pass actual value to the function, pass the address of the value, or passing a reference to the function. Each has a different methadology and application.
```c++
int var1 = 5;
int var2 = 10
int *ptr;
ptr = &var1;   // pointer has the address of var1
int &ref = var1;  // now var1 and ref has the same address 
ptr = &var2;  // pointer addres can follow each variable it is assigned to, but refrence are assigned to 
one variable only
```

### Pass by value 
We pass a copy of the value when we did not want to change the actual value of the variable 
```c++
void passByVal(int val)
{
  val = 10;
  cout<< "val = " << val;
}
int main()
{
 int x = 5;
 cout<< "x = "<< x << endl; //5
 passByVal(x);
 cout<< "x = "<< x << endl; //5
 
 }
```

### Pass by pointer
we are passing the address of the variable.
```c++
void passByPtr(int *ptr)
{
  *ptr = 20;
  cout<< "*ptr = " << *ptr;
  int main()
{
 int x = 5;
 cout<< "x = "<< x << endl; //5
 passByPtr(&x); //20
 cout<< "x = "<< x << endl; //20
 
}
```


### Pass by reference
we pass the actual value of the variable.
**pass by refrence VS pass by pointer**
References are usually implemented by pointers. A refrence is same object with a different name. Reference must refere to an object and cannot be NULL so it is safer to use.
* pointers can be assigned, reference cannot.
* pointers can be null.
* pointers can iterate over an array.
* pointer is a variable that hold memory address, reference has the same memory as the object .
* pointers need to be dereferenced to acces the memory while the reference can be used directly. 


```c++
void passByRef(int &ref)
{
  ref = 30;
  cout<< "ref = " << ref;
 }
  int main()
{
 int x = 5;
 cout<< "x = "<< x << endl; //5
 passByRef(x); //30
 cout<< "x = "<< x << endl; //30

}
```

### Pass by  pointer reference
we are making a reference to the pointer. Thus we want to modify the pointer without modifying the object that the pointer is pointing to. 
```c++
int n1 = 1;
int n2 = 2;
int* p2;
void passByPtr(int *ptr);
void passByPtrRef(int *&ptrRef);
int main(){
int* p1 = &n1;
p2 = &n2;
passByPtr(&n1);
passByPtrRef(p1);
return 0;
}
void passByPtr(int *p1)
{
 *ptr= 3;
 ptr= p2;
 *ptr = 4;
 cout<< "pass by pointer"<< endl;
}

void passByPtrRef(int *&ptrRef)
{
 *ptrRef = 5;
 ptrRef = p2;
 *ptrRef = 6;
 cout<< "pass by pointer reference"<< endl;
 }
```
